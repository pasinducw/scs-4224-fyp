# Guide for the notes

### 001
Constant-Q spectrum amplitude with decibel vs raw representation for "Badinerie", played on keyboard
Conclusions: Feed in the debicel converted data for the next steps of pipeline
Reasons: dB scale follows the natural hearing system of humans. Therefore more meaningful data can be drawn out from it

### 002
Constant-Q spectrum amplitude with a custom log function applied for "Badinerie", played on keyboard

### 003
Constant-Q spectrum of a performance of "A whiter shade of pale" song (decibel scale)

### 004
Get the constant-Q spectrum. Transform into the decibel amphlitudes, and find the maximum in each time step.
For each time step, set all other frequency bins to zero leaving out the maximum; on the constant-Q spectrum.
Transform the modified constant-Q spectrum to the decibel amphilitudes, and plot the graph

### 005
Same process as 004, done to 005.png
005 Denotes a C major scale played on a piano.
