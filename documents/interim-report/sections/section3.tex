\subsection{Research Tools}
This research is expected to be conducted using the best practices of scientific experimentation and scientific writing. Hence several tools are used to make this possible. \LaTeX\footnote{https://www.latex-project.org} is used to create scientific documents such as this. Zotero\footnote{https://www.zotero.org} reference management tool is used to keep track, classify, and to securely store the literature discovered through the internet. Moreover, Zotero's support for bibliography management is extensively used with \LaTeX\ to create documents. Notion\footnote{https://www.notion.so} is used to keep notes on important publications. Trello\footnote{https://trello.com} is used to keep track of the progress of the research. Miro\footnote{https://miro.com} is used to visually jot down the thoughts and concepts, and it is used extensively to map the relationships found between publications. Experiments are conducted using Jupyter Notebooks\footnote{https://jupyter.org}, and PyTorch\footnote{https://pytorch.org} is used as the main library to build neural networks. Git\footnote{https://git-scm.com} version controlling system is used to keep track of the experiments, and is hosted on GitHub\footnote{https://github.com} for safety.
