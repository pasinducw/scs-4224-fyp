In this paper we present a low-power music recognizer that runs entirely on a mobile device and automatically recognizes music without user interaction. To reduce battery consumption, a small music detector runs continuously on the mobile device's DSP chip and wakes up the main application processor only when it is confident that music is present. Once woken, the recognizer on the application processor is provided with a few seconds of audio which is fingerprinted and compared to the stored fingerprints in the on-device fingerprint database of tens of thousands of songs. Our presented system, Now Playing, has a daily battery usage of less than 1\% on average, respects user privacy by running entirely on-device and can passively recognize a wide range of music.},

  abstract = {Audio fingerprinting techniques were developed to index and retrieve audio samples by comparing a content-based compact signature of the audio instead of the entire audio sample, thereby reducing memory and computational expense. Different techniques have been applied to create audio fingerprints, however, with the introduction of deep learning, new data-driven unsupervised approaches are available.    This doctoral dissertation presents a Sequence-to-Sequence Autoencoder Model for Audio Fingerprinting (SAMAF) which improved hash generation through a novel loss function composed of terms: Mean Square Error, minimizing the reconstruction error; Hash Loss, minimizing the distance between similar hashes and encouraging clustering; and Bitwise Entropy Loss, minimizing the variation inside the clusters.    The performance of the model was assessed with a subset of VoxCeleb1 dataset, a "speech in-the-wild" dataset. Furthermore, the model was compared against three baselines: Dejavu, a Shazam-like algorithm; Robust Audio Fingerprinting System  (RAFS), a Bit Error Rate (BER) methodology robust to time-frequency distortions and coding/decoding transformations; and Panako, a constellation algorithm-based adding time-frequency distortion resilience.    Extensive empirical evidence showed that our approach outperformed all the baselines in the audio identification task and other classification tasks related to the attributes of the audio signal with an economical hash size of either 128 or 256 bits  for one second of audio.     Additionally, the developed technology was deployed into two 9-1-1 Emergency Operation Centers (EOCs), located in Palm Beach County (PBC) and Greater Harris County (GH), allowing us to evaluate the performance in real-time in an industrial  environment.},

The first two cover foundations of music representations and the Fourier transform\textemdash concepts that are then used throughout the book. In the subsequent chapters, concrete music processing tasks serve as a starting point. Each of these chapters is organized in a similar fashion and starts with a general description of the music processing scenario at hand before integrating it into a wider context. It then discusses\textemdash in a mathematically rigorous way\textemdash important techniques and algorithms that are generally applicable to a wide range of analysis, classification, and retrieval problems. At the same time, the techniques are directly applied to a specific music processing task. By mixing theory and practice, the book's goal is to offer detailed technological insights as well as a deep understanding of music processing applications. Each chapter ends with a section that includes links to the research literature, suggestions for further reading, a list of references, and exercises. The chapters are organized in a modular fashion, thus offering lecturers and readers many ways to choose, rearrange or supplement the material. Accordingly, selected chapters or individual sections can easily be integrated into courses on general multimedia, information science, signal processing, music informatics, or the digital humanities.},

The increase of the music databases on the personal collection and the Internet has brought a great demand for music information retrieval, and especially automatic musical genre classification. In this research we focused on combining information from the audio signal than different sources. This paper presents a comprehensive machine learning approach to the problem of automatic musical genre classification using the audio signal. The proposed approach uses two feature vectors, Support vector machine classifier with polynomial kernel function and machine learning algorithms. More specifically, two feature sets for representing frequency domain, temporal domain, cepstral domain and modulation frequency domain audio features are proposed. Using our proposed features SVM act as strong base learner in AdaBoost, so its performance of the SVM classifier cannot improve using boosting method. The final genre classification is obtained from the set of individual results according to a weighting combination late fusion method and it outperformed the trained fusion method. Music genre classification accuracy of 78\% and 81\% is reported on the GTZAN dataset over the ten musical genres and the ISMIR2004 genre dataset over the six musical genres, respectively. We observed higher classification accuracies with the ensembles, than with the individual classifiers and improvements of the performances on the GTZAN and ISMIR2004 genre datasets are three percent on average. This ensemble approach show that it is possible to improve the classification accuracy by using different types of domain based audio features.},

To combat this problem, we first explore user listening history and demographics to construct a user embedding representing the user's music preference. With the user embedding and audio data from user's liked and disliked tracks, an audio embedding can be obtained for each track using metric learning with Siamese networks. For a new track, we can decide the best group of users to recommend by computing the similarity between the track's audio embedding and different user embeddings, respectively. The proposed system yields state-of-the-art performance on content-based music recommendation tested with millions of users and tracks. Also, we extract audio embeddings as features for music genre classification tasks. The results show the generalization ability of our audio embeddings.},

  abstract = {A novel framework for background music identification is proposed in this paper. Given a piece of audio signals that mixes background music with speech/noise, we identify the music part with source music data. Conventional methods that take the whole audio signals for identification are inap- propriate in terms of efficiency and accuracy. In our frame- work, the audio content is filtered through speech center cancellation and noise removal to extract clear music seg- ments. To identify these music segments, we use a compact feature representation and efficient similarity measurement based on the min-hash theory. The results of experiments on the RWC music database show a promising direction. To alleviate the above problems, we propose a novel framework for background music identification. Two prac- tical steps are employed to analyze the audio signal. First, based on our observation in TV broadcasting and video, we leverage the stereo format capability to cancel the speech that is panned to the center. Second, for noise and speech that cannot be cancelled, they are located through GMM- based classification and removed to obtain clear music snip- pets for identification. Thus, we can reduce unnecessary comparisons and false positives. To achieve efficient and accurate identification, we present a min-hash-based feature representation and similar- ity measurement. Each music frame is represented by a one- dimensional min-hash value, and the similarity between two music segments is computed by their hash collision rate. Fig. 1 shows an overview of the proposed framework. We vali- date the framework through several experiments performed on the RWC music database (5). The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Sections 2 and 3 describe the content filtering and min-hash indexing, respectively. Sections 4 and 5 summarize the ex- periment results and conclusions, respectively.}

This paper focuses on the problem of music identification, where the goal is to reliably identify a song given a few seconds of noisy audio. Our approach treats the spectrogram of each music clip as a 2-D image and transforms music identification into a corrupted sub-image retrieval problem. By employing pairwise boosting on a large set of Viola-Jones features, our system learns compact, discriminative, local descriptors that are amenable to efficient indexing. During the query phase, we retrieve the set of song snippets that locally match the noisy sample and employ geometric verification in conjunction with an EM-based ``occlusion'' model to identify the song that is most consistent with the observed signal. We have implemented our algorithm in a practical system that can quickly and accurately recognize music from short audio samples in the presence of distortions such as poor recording quality and significant ambient noise. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach significantly outperforms the current state-of-theart in content-based music identification.},

Original algorithms proposed for this task have proven their accuracy on small datasets, but are unable to scale up to modern real-life audio corpora. On the other hand, faster approaches designed to process thousands of pairwise comparisons resulted in lower accuracy, making them unsuitable for practical use. In this work, we propose a neural network architecture that is trained to represent each track as a single embedding vector. The computation burden is therefore left to the embedding extraction -- that can be conducted offline and stored, while the pairwise comparison task reduces to a simple Euclidean distance computation. We further propose to extract each track's embedding out of its dominant melody representation, obtained by another neural network trained for this task. We then show that this architecture improves state-of-the-art accuracy both on small and large datasets, and is able to scale to query databases of thousands of tracks in a few seconds.},

An RNN model is a set of coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations in continuous time domain with nonlinear dynamic node characteristics as well as both feedforward and feedback connections. For such networks, each physical input to a system corresponds to exactly one input to the network. The system's dynamics are captured by the internal structure of the network. The structure of RNN models may be more natural and attractive than that of feedforward neural network models, but computation time for training is longer. Our simulation results show that RNNs can learn both steady-state relationships and process dynamics of continuous and batch, single-input/single-output and multiinput/multioutput systems in a simple and direct manner. Training of RNNs shows only small degradation in the presence of noise in the training data. Thus, RNNs constitute a feasible alternative to layered feedforward back propagation neural networks in steady-state and dynamic process modeling and model-based control.},

The longterm structure is determined from envelope of audio energy versus time in one or more frequency bands. Similarity between energy profiles is calculated using dynamic programming. Given an example audio document, other documents in a collection can be ranked by similarity of their energy profiles. Experiments are presented for a modest corpus that demonstrate excellent results in retrieving different performances of the same orchestral work, given an example performance or short excerpt as a query.},

We identify a weakness of LSTM networks processing continual input streams that are not a priori segmented into subsequences with explicitly marked ends at which the network's internal state could be reset. Without resets, the state may grow indefinitely and eventually cause the network to break down. Our remedy is a novel, adaptive "forget gate" that enables an LSTM cell to learn to reset itself at appropriate times, thus releasing internal resources. We review illustrative benchmark problems on which standard LSTM outperforms other RNN algorithms. All algorithms (including LSTM) fail to solve continual versions of these problems. LSTM with forget gates, however, easily solves them, and in an elegant way.},

This paper focuses on the analysis of tonal similarity and its application to the identification of different versions of the same piece. This work formulates the situations where a song is versioned and several musical aspects are transformed with respect to the canonical version. A quantitative evaluation is made using tonal descriptors, including chroma representations and tonality. A simple similarity measure, based on Dynamic Time Warping over transposed chroma features, yields around 55 \% accuracy, which exceeds by far the expected random baseline rate.},

  abstract = {The rapidly growing corpus of digital audio material requires novel retrieval strategies for exploring large music collections. Traditional retrieval strategies rely on metadata that describe the actual audio content in words. In the case that such textual descriptions are not available, one requires content-based retrieval strategies which only utilize the raw audio material. In this contribution, we discuss content-based retrieval strategies that follow the query-by-example paradigm: given an audio query, the task is to retrieve all documents that are somehow similar or related to the query from a music collection. Such strategies can be loosely classified according to their specificity, which refers to the degree of similarity between the query and the database documents. Here, high specificity refers to a strict notion of similarity, whereas low specificity to a rather vague one. Furthermore, we introduce a second classification principle based on granularity, where one distinguishes between fragment-level and document-level retrieval. Using a classification scheme based on specificity and granularity, we identify various classes of retrieval scenarios, which comprise audio identification, audio matching, and version identification. For these three important classes, we give an overview of representative state-of-the-art approaches, which also illustrate the sometimes subtle but crucial differences between the retrieval scenarios. Finally, we give an outlook on a user-oriented retrieval system, which combines the various retrieval strategies in a unified framework.},

  abstract = {Imagine the following situation. You're in your car, listening to the radio and suddenly you hear a song that catches your attention. It's the best new song you have heard for a long time, but you missed the announcement and don't recognize the artist. Still, you would like to know more about this music. What should you do? You could call the radio station, but that's too cumbersome. Wouldn't it be nice if you could push a few buttons on your mobile phone and a few seconds later the phone would respond with the name of the artist and the title of the music you're listening to? Perhaps even sending an email to your default email address with some supplemental information. In this paper we present an audio fingerprinting system, which makes the above scenario possible. By using the fingerprint of an unknown audio clip as a query on a fingerprint database, which contains the fingerprints of a large library of songs, the audio clip can be identified. At the core of the presented system are a highly robust fingerprint extraction method and a very efficient fingerprint search strategy, which enables searching a large fingerprint database with only limited computing resources.},

Visual displays of an audio signal, through various time-frequency representations such as spectrograms offer a rich representation of the temporal and spectral structure of the original signal. In this letter, we compare various popular signal processing methods to obtain this representation, such as short-time Fourier transform (STFT) with linear and Mel scales, constant-Q transform (CQT) and continuous Wavelet transform (CWT), and assess their impact on the classification performance of two environmental sound datasets using CNNs. This study supports the hypothesis that time-frequency representations are valuable in learning useful features for sound classification. Moreover, the actual transformation used is shown to impact the classification accuracy, with Mel-scaled STFT outperforming the other discussed methods slightly and baseline MFCC features to a large degree. Additionally, we observe that the optimal window size during transformation is dependent on the characteristics of the audio signal and architecturally, 2D convolution yielded better results in most cases compared to 1D.},

However, the aspect of temporal progression of music, which is important for measuring the melody similarity between two tracks, is not well represented by fixed-length vectors. In this paper, we propose a new Siamese network architecture for music melody similarity metric learning. The architecture consists of two parts. One part is a network for learning the deep sequence representation of music tracks, and the other is a similarity estimation network which takes as input the crosssimilarity matrices calculated from the deep sequences of a pair of tracks. The two networks are jointly trained and optimized to achieve high melody similarity prediction accuracy. Experiments conducted on several public datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed architecture.},

Many of these approaches are ultimately based on a dynamic programming approach such as sequence alignment or edit distance, which has various drawbacks. First, the similarity scores are not necessarily metrics and are not directly comparable. Second, the algorithms are mostly first-order and of quadratic timecomplexity, and finally, the features and weights need to be defined precisely. We propose an alternative approach which employs deep neural networks for end-to-end similarity metric learning. We contrast and compare different recurrent neural architectures (LSTM and GRU) for representing symbolic melodies as continuous vectors, and demonstrate how duplet and triplet loss functions can be employed to learn compact distributional representations of symbolic music in an induced melody space. This approach is contrasted with an alignment-based approach. We present results for the Meertens Tune Collections, which consists of a large number of vocal and instrumental monophonic pieces from Dutch musical sources, spanning five centuries, and demonstrate the robustness of the learned similarity metrics.},

  abstract = {Previously, we proposed a histogram-based quick signal search method called Time-Series Active Search (TAS). TAS is a method of searching through long audio or video recordings for a specified segment, based on signal similarity. TAS is fast; it can search through a 24-hour recording in 1 second after a query-independent preprocessing. However, an even faster method is required when we consider a huge amount of audio archives, for example a month's worth of recordings. Thus, we propose a preprocessing method that significantly accelerates TAS. The core part of this method comprises a global histogram clustering of long signals and a pruning scheme using those clusters. Tests using broadcast recording indicate that the proposed algorithm achieves a search speed approximately 3 to 30 times faster than TAS. In these tests, the search results are exactly the same as with TAS.},

We consider two types of nonlinear transforms which describe the network representations. One of the nonlinear transforms serves as activation function. The other one enables a locally adjusted, deviation corrective components to be included in the update of the network weights in order to enable attaining target specific representations at the last network node. Our learning principle not only provides insight into the understanding and the interpretation of the learning dynamics, but it offers theoretical guarantees over decoupled and parallel parameter estimation strategy that enables learning in synchronous and asynchronous mode. Numerical experiments validate the potential of our approach on image recognition task. The preliminary results show advantages in comparison to the state-of-the-art methods, w.r.t. the learning time and the network size while having competitive recognition accuracy.},

The task is to identify a different version or performance of a previously recorded song. Unlike audio search for an exact matching song, this task has not yet been popularized among users, due to an ambiguous definition of a cover song and the complexity of the problem. With a great variety of methods proposed on the benchmarking challenges, it is increasingly difficult to compare advantages and disadvantages of the features and algorithms. We provide a comparison of three levels of feature extraction (chroma features, chroma vector distances, chord distances) and show how each level affects the results. We further distinguish five scores for dynamic time warping method, to find the best performance in conjunction with the features. Results were evaluated on covers80 and SecondHandSongs datasets and compared to the state-of-the-art.},

This paper presents a novel local audio fingerprint called MASK (Masked Audio Spectral Keypoints) that can effectively encode the acoustic information existent in audio documents and discriminate between transformed versions of the same acoustic documents and other unrelated documents. The fingerprint has been designed to be resilient to strong transformations of the original signal and to be usable for generic audio, including music and speech. Its main characteristics are its locality, binary encoding, robustness and compactness. The proposed audio fingerprint encodes the local spectral energies around salient points selected among the main spectral peaks in a given signal. Such encoding is done by centering on each point a carefully designed mask defining regions of the spectrogram whose average energies are compared with each other. From each comparison we obtain a single bit depending on which region has more energy, and group all bits into a final binary fingerprint. In addition, the fingerprint also stores the frequency of each peak, quantized using a Mel filterbank. The length of the fingerprint is solely defined by the number of compared regions being used, and can be adapted to the requirements of any particular application. In addition, the number of salient points encoded per second can be also easily modified. In the experimental section we show the suitability of such fingerprint to find matching segments by using the NIST-TRECVID benchmarking evaluation datasets by comparing it with a well known fingerprint, obtaining up to 26\% relative improvement in NDCR score.},

Comparatively, more recent music information retrieval tasks take advantage of temporal structure in audio spectrograms using deep convolutional and recurrent models. This paper revisits artist classification with this new framework and empirically explores the impacts of incorporating temporal structure in the feature representation. To this end, an established classification architecture, a Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN), is applied to the artist20 music artist identification dataset under a comprehensive set of conditions. These include audio clip length, which is a novel contribution in this work, and previously identified considerations such as dataset split and feature level. Our results improve upon baseline works, verify the influence of the producer effect on classification performance and demonstrate the trade-offs between audio length and training set size. The best performing model achieves an average F1 score of 0.937 across three independent trials which is a substantial improvement over the corresponding baseline under similar conditions. Additionally, to showcase the effectiveness of the CRNN's feature extraction capabilities, we visualize audio samples at the model's bottleneck layer demonstrating that learned representations segment into clusters belonging to their respective artists.},

You simply start the application on your mobile phone, capture (or tag) the music for a few seconds and after just 10 seconds (after communicating with its remote servers) it will identify the song and display the informations (name, artist and album).

The main difficulty is to develop an algorithm that is able to capture by a little cellphone microphone a short audio sample of music often with mixed heavy ambient noise and perform quickly the identification over a large database of music with nearly 2M tracks.

To address this issue, we propose the use of a hierarchical decoder, which first outputs embeddings for subsequences of the input and then uses these embeddings to generate each subsequence independently. This structure encourages the model to utilize its latent code, thereby avoiding the "posterior collapse" problem, which remains an issue for recurrent VAEs. We apply this architecture to modeling sequences of musical notes and find that it exhibits dramatically better sampling, interpolation, and reconstruction performance than a "flat" baseline model.

An inverse transform is proposed which enables a reasonable-quality (around 55dB signal-to-noise ratio) reconstruction of the original signal from its CQT coefficients. Here CQTs with high Q-factors, equivalent to 12\textendash 96 bins per octave, are of particular interest. The proposed method is flexible with regard to the number of bins per octave, the applied window function, and the Q-factor, and is particularly suitable for the analysis of music signals. A reference implementation of the proposed methods is published as a Matlab toolbox. The toolbox includes user-interface tools that facilitate spectral data visualization and the indexing and working with the data structure produced by the CQT.},

Cover song identification is a task whose popularity has increased in the music information retrieval (MIR) community along in the past, as it provides a direct and objective way to evaluate music similarity algorithms. This paper first presents a series of experiments carried out with two state-of-the-art methods for cover song identification. We have studied several components of these (such as chroma resolution and similarity, transposition, beat tracking or dynamic time warping constraints), in order to discover which characteristics would be desirable for a competitive cover song identifier. After analyzing many cross-validated results, the importance of these characteristics is discussed, and the best performing ones are finally applied to the newly proposed method. Multiple evaluations of this one confirm a large increase in identification accuracy when comparing it with alternative state-of-the-art approaches.},

In particular, we address the automatic identification of cover songs, i.e. alternative renditions of a previously recorded musical piece. For this purpose, we here propose a recurrence quantification analysis measure that allows the tracking of potentially curved and disrupted traces in cross recurrence plots (CRPs). We apply this measure to CRPs constructed from the state space representation of musical descriptor time series extracted from the raw audio signal. We show that our method identifies cover songs with a higher accuracy as compared to previously published techniques. Beyond the particular application proposed here, we discuss how our approach can be useful for the characterization of a variety of signals from different scientific disciplines. We study coupled R\"ossler dynamics with stochastically modulated mean frequencies as one concrete example to illustrate this point.},

We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach in detecting music structure boundaries, a task that has received much attention in recent years and for which exist several benchmark datasets and publicly available annotations. We find our method to significantly outperform the best accuracies published so far.

In the real-world environment, music queries are often deformed by various interferences which typically include signal distortions and time-frequency misalignments caused by time stretching, pitch shifting, etc. Therefore, robustness plays a crucial role in music identification technique. In this paper, we propose to use scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) local descriptors computed from a spectrogram image as sub-fingerprints for music identification. Experiments show that these sub-fingerprints exhibit strong robustness against serious time stretching and pitch shifting simultaneously. In addition, a locality sensitive hashing (LSH)-based nearest sub-fingerprint retrieval method and a matching determination mechanism are applied for robust sub-fingerprint matching, which makes the identification efficient and precise. Finally, as an auxiliary function, we demonstrate that by comparing the time-frequency locations of corresponding SIFT keypoints, the factor of time stretching and pitch shifting that music queries might have experienced can be accurately estimated.},

In this paper a scalable granular acoustic fingerprinting system robust against time and pitch scale modification is presented. The aim of acoustic fingerprinting is to identify identical, or recognize similar, audio fragments in a large set using condensed representations of audio signals, i.e. fingerprints. A robust fingerprinting system generates similar fingerprints for perceptually similar audio signals. The new system, presented here, handles a variety of distortions well. It is designed to be robust against pitch shifting, time stretching and tempo changes, while remaining scalable. After a query, the system returns the start time in the reference audio, and the amount of pitch shift and tempo change that has been applied. The design of the system that offers this unique combination of features is the main contribution of this research. The fingerprint itself consists of a combination of key points in a Constant-Q spectrogram. The system is evaluated on commodity hardware using a freely available reference database with fingerprints of over 30.000 songs. The results show that the system responds quickly and reliably on queries, while handling time and pitch scale modifications of up to ten percent.},

Most current approaches compute the similarity between two melodic sequences by comparing their local features (distance between pitches, intervals, etc.) or by comparing the sequences after aligning them. In order to find a better feature representing global characteristics of a melody, we propose to represent the melodic sequence of each musical piece by the parameters of a generative Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) trained on its sequence. Because the trained RNN can generate the identical melodic sequence of each piece, we can expect that the RNN parameters contain the temporal information within the melody. In our experiment, we first train an RNN on all melodic sequences, and then use it as an initialisation to train an individual RNN on each melodic sequence. The similarity between two melodies is computed by using the distance between their individual RNN parameters. Experimental results showed that the proposed RNN-based similarity outperformed the baseline similarity obtained by directly comparing melodic sequences.},

Specify before the analysis what kinds of patterns you would expect and what you would find exciting. The results of the analysis depend on the scaling of the matrix, which therefore must be specified. Variance scaling, where each variable is scaled to unit variance, can be recommended for general use, provided that almost constant variables are left unscaled. Combining different types of variables warrants blockscaling. In the initial analysis, look for outliers and strong groupings in the plots, indicating that the data matrix perhaps should be ``polished'' or whether disjoint modeling is the proper course. For plotting purposes, two or three principal components are usually sufficient, but for modeling purposes the number of significant components should be properly determined, e.g. by cross-validation.

For these and other applications requiring good metrics, it is desirable that we provide a more systematic way for users to indicate what they consider ``similar.'' For instance, we may ask them to provide examples. In this paper, we present an algorithm that, given examples of similar (and, if desired, dissimilar) pairs of points in \textcent\textcurrency\textsterling{} , learns a distance metric over \textcent\textyen\textsterling{} that respects these relationships. Our method is based on posing metric learning as a convex optimization problem, which allows us to give efficient, local-optima-free algorithms.

  abstract = {With the rapid development of the mobile internet of things (IoTs) and mobile sensing devices, a large amount of mobile computing-oriented applications have attracted attention both from industry and academia. Deep learning based methods have achieved great success in artificial intelligence (AI) oriented applications. To advance the development of AI-based IoT systems, effective and efficient algorithms are in urgent need for IoT Edge Computing. Time-series data classification is an ongoing problem in applications for mobile devices (e.g. music genre classification on mobile phones). However, the traditional methods require field expertise to extract handcrafted features from the time-series data. Deep learning has been demonstrated to be effective and efficient in this kind of data. Nevertheless, the existing works neglect some of the sequential relationships found in the time-series data, which are significant for time-series data classification. Considering the aforementioned limitations, we propose a hybrid architecture, named the parallel recurrent convolutional neural network (PRCNN). The PRCNN is an end-to-end training network that combines feature extraction and time-series data classification in one stage. The parallel CNN and Bi-RNN blocks focus on extracting the spatial features and temporal frame orders, respectively, and the outputs of two blocks are fused into one powerful representation of the time-series data. Then, the syncretic vector is fed into the softmax function for classification. The parallel network structure guarantees that the extracted features are robust enough to represent the time-series data. Moreover, the experimental results demonstrate that our proposed architecture outperforms the previous approaches applied to the same datasets.

  abstract = {The version identification (VI) task deals with the automatic detection of recordings that correspond to the same underlying musical piece. Despite many efforts, VI is still an open problem, with much room for improvement, specially with regard to combining accuracy and scalability. In this paper, we present MOVE, a musically-motivated method for accurate and scalable version identification. MOVE achieves state-of-the-art performance on two publicly-available benchmark sets by learning scalable embeddings in an Euclidean distance space, using a triplet loss and a hard triplet mining strategy. It improves over previous work by employing an alternative input representation, and introducing a novel technique for temporal content summarization, a standardized latent space, and a data augmentation strategy specifically designed for VI. In addition to the main results, we perform an ablation study to highlight the importance of our design choices, and study the relation between embedding dimensionality and model performance.},

  abstract = {This paper focuses on Cover Song Identification (CSI), an important research challenge in content-based Music Information Retrieval (MIR). Although the task itself is interesting and challenging for both academia and industry scenarios, there are a number of limitations for the advancement of current approaches. We specifically address two of them in the present study. First, the number of publicly available datasets for this task is limited, and there is no publicly available benchmark set that is widely used among researchers for comparative algorithm evaluation. Second, most of the algorithms are not publicly shared and reproducible, limiting the comparison of approaches. To overcome these limitations we propose Da-TACOS, a DaTAset for COver Song Identification and Understanding, and two frameworks for feature extraction and benchmarking to facilitate reproducibility. Da-TACOS contains 25K songs represented by unique editorial metadata plus 9 low- and mid-level features pre-computed with open source libraries, and is divided into two subsets. The Cover Analysis subset contains audio features (e.g. key, tempo) that can serve to study how musical characteristics vary for cover songs. The Benchmark subset contains the set of features that have been frequently used in CSI research, e.g. chroma, MFCC, beat onsets etc. Moreover, we provide initial benchmarking results of a selected number of state-of-the-art CSI algorithms using our dataset, and for reproducibility, we share a GitHub repository containing the feature extraction and benchmarking frameworks.},

Due to various musical and non-musical changes in live performances, developing automatic SLI systems is still a challenging task that, despite its industrial relevance, has been under-explored in the academic literature. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end workflow that identifies relevant metadata and timestamps of live music performances using a version identification system. We compare 3 of such systems to investigate their suitability for this particular task. For developing and evaluating SLI systems, we also contribute a new dataset that contains 99.5h of concerts with annotated metadata and timestamps, along with the corresponding reference set. The dataset is categorized by audio qualities and genres to analyze the performance of SLI systems in different use cases. Our approach can identify 68\% of the annotated segments, with values ranging from 35\% to 77\% based on the genre. Finally, we evaluate our approach against a database of 56.8k songs to illustrate the effect of expanding the reference set, where we can still identify 56\% of the annotated segments.},

  abstract = {Version identification systems aim to detect different renditions of the same underlying musical composition (loosely called cover songs). By learning to encode entire recordings into plain vector embeddings, recent systems have made significant progress in bridging the gap between accuracy and scalability, which has been a key challenge for nearly two decades. In this work, we propose to further narrow this gap by employing a set of data distillation techniques that reduce the embedding dimensionality of a pre-trained state-of-the-art model. We compare a wide range of techniques and propose new ones, from classical dimensionality reduction to more sophisticated distillation schemes. With those, we obtain 99\% smaller embeddings that, moreover, yield up to a 3\% accuracy increase. Such small embeddings can have an important impact in retrieval time, up to the point of making a real-world system practical on a standalone laptop.},

We find that although RNN-based generative models are more powerful than their bag-of-words ancestors (e.g., they account for conditional dependencies across words in a document), they have higher asymptotic error rates than discriminatively trained RNN models. However we also find that generative models approach their asymptotic error rate more rapidly than their discriminative counterparts---the same pattern that Ng \& Jordan (2001) proved holds for linear classification models that make more naive conditional independence assumptions. Building on this finding, we hypothesize that RNN-based generative classification models will be more robust to shifts in the data distribution. This hypothesis is confirmed in a series of experiments in zero-shot and continual learning settings that show that generative models substantially outperform discriminative models.},

  abstract = {The rise of video-sharing platforms has attracted more and more people to shoot videos and upload them to the Internet. These videos mostly contain a carefully-edited background audio track, where serious speech change, pitch shifting and various types of audio effects may involve, and existing audio identification systems may fail to recognize the audio. To solve this problem, in this paper, we introduce the idea of contrastive learning to the task of audio fingerprinting (AFP). Contrastive learning is an unsupervised approach to learn representations that can effectively group similar samples and discriminate dissimilar ones. In our work, we consider an audio track and its differently distorted versions as similar while considering different audio tracks as dissimilar. Based on the momentum contrast (MoCo) framework, we devise a contrastive learning method for AFP, which can generate fingerprints that are both discriminative and robust. A set of experiments showed that our AFP method is effective for audio identification, with robustness to serious audio distortions, including the challenging speed change and pitch shifting.},

In this paper, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are used for representation learning toward this task. We show that they could be naturally adapted to deal with key transposition in cover songs. Additionally, Temporal Pyramid Pooling is utilized to extract information on different scales and transform songs with different lengths into fixed-dimensional representations. Furthermore, a training scheme is designed to enhance the robustness of our model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that combined with these techniques, our approach is robust against musical variations existing in cover songs and outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several datasets with low time complexity.},
